I think you're changin' your mind | cuvinte=6 | vocale=10
Startin' to see it in your eyes | cuvinte=7 | vocale=11
I used to love a good surprise | cuvinte=7 | vocale=12
And now I'd rather know ahead of time | cuvinte=8 | vocale=12
You said "I love you" too fast | cuvinte=7 | vocale=12
So much for that, 'cause summer just started | cuvinte=8 | vocale=12
And we're already done | cuvinte=4 | vocale=8
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me | cuvinte=11 | vocale=17
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me | cuvinte=9 | vocale=16
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me | cuvinte=14 | vocale=22
I expected more from you honestly | cuvinte=6 | vocale=11
Said you want a simple life and that's not me | cuvinte=10 | vocale=14
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like | cuvinte=12 | vocale=18
How can you be angry on a night in July | cuvinte=10 | vocale=11
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside | cuvinte=9 | vocale=14
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time | cuvinte=9 | vocale=15
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast | cuvinte=8 | vocale=14

And we're already done | cuvinte=4 | vocale=8
I kept it decent, I kept you sane | cuvinte=8 | vocale=11
I kept it peaceful, don't lie | cuvinte=6 | vocale=10
I kept it decent, even the secrets | cuvinte=7 | vocale=10
Kept it between you and I | cuvinte=6 | vocale=9
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart | cuvinte=6 | vocale=11
Breakin' me down when I'm already down | cuvinte=7 | vocale=11
Breakin' my heart- breakin' my heart- breakin' my heart | cuvinte=9 | vocale=15
Breakin' my heart- breakin' my heart | cuvinte=6 | vocale=10
Brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- | cuvinte=12 | vocale=24
